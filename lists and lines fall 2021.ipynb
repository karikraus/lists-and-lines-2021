    "# Understanding Lists and Transforming Poetic Lines  \n",
    "In Python, a list is an ordered sequence of items. While a list is its own unique data type, individual elements within the list can be of different types, such as letters, words, or numbers. Many combinatorial poems make extensive use of lists. You can slice a list, sort it, loop through it, add and remove items from it, and otherwise manipulate it. Understanding lists is therefore crucial for advancing your practice as a computational poet. One of the things that can sometimes make working with lists challenging is that they can behave so much like strings, especially when the individual items are text of some kind. This is because strings and lists, while distinct, are nonetheless united in both being types of *sequences*: successions or chains of elements. As such, they share many similarities. As we shall see, lists and strings also work synergistically in poetry generation. For these reasons, we'll begin this notebook with a quick review of the string data type that we learned about in our previous notebook before moving on to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by Allison Parrish's excellent tutorial: https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/understanding-lists-manipulating-lines.ipynb. I've specifically tried to capture and preserve Parrish's foregrounding of how lists and strings can interact when creating text generators. The organization thus adheres closely to hers, while the explanations and most of the examples are mine. I've also made use of a fragment of code from Nick Montfort's [reimplementation of Alison Knowles' \"House of Dust\"](https://nickm.com/memslam/a_house_of_dust.html). Finally, I've followed Parrish in using [\"Sea Rose\" by H.D.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48188/sea-rose) to illustrate some key concepts."

On the contrary, their duality is signaled at the level of syntax: a word within a list, for example, is enclosed within quotation marks to indicate its individual status as a string, while simultaneously being embedded in square brackets alongside other items to indicate its membership in a list. Numbers, in turn, differentiate themselves from letters by foregoing the quotation marks. The Python interactive interpreter is constantly dealing with list elements at both syntactical levels. In the case of the sum() function, for example, it first assesses the data type of individual elements to determine if they're numerical before subsequently adding them all together at the list level. This double structure is a hallmark of lists."

The new line character is \"\\n\" (inclusive of the quotation marks in your print statement)."

    "EXERCISE 2: Apply each of the different functions available in the \"random\" library to the sea rose poem. As a refresher, the three we worked with are random.sample, random.choice, and random.shuffle. Try applying each of them to the poem at the level of lines (e.g., write a simple program that randomly shuffles the lines of the sea-rose poem (random.shuffle), then write a new program that randomly selects and prints one line of the poem (random.choice), then write a third program that randomly samples some specific number of lines (3 or 4 or however many you want). Hint: to work with the poem at the level of lines, you'll want to split the poem at the end of each line. And don't forget to import the \"random\" library. Here's what your first three lines of code for each of these programs will look like:\n",

    "From there, you'll want to review how to apply each of the random functions by visiting my Jupyter notebook or Allison Parrish's tutorial. One more hint: for both random.shuffle and random.sample, you'll want to use the join operation toward the end to turn your list back into a string. So the third line of each program turns your string into a list of lines, and then for two of the functions, you'll want to turn those lists back into strings before you print them. Your last line in each program will use the \"print\" command."
