    "# Understanding Lists and Transforming Poetic Lines  \n",
    "In Python, a list is an ordered sequence of items. While a list is its own unique data type, individual elements within the list can be of different types, such as letters, words, or numbers. Many combinatorial poems make extensive use of lists. You can slice a list, sort it, loop through it, add and remove items from it, and otherwise manipulate it. Understanding lists is therefore crucial for advancing your practice as a computational poet. One of the things that can sometimes make working with lists challenging is that they can behave so much like strings, especially when the individual items are text of some kind. This is because strings and lists, while distinct, are nonetheless united in both being types of *sequences*: successions or chains of elements. As such, they share many similarities. As we shall see, lists and strings also work synergistically in poetry generation. For these reasons, we'll begin this notebook with a quick review of the string data type that we learned about in our previous notebook before moving on to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by Allison Parrish's excellent tutorial: https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/understanding-lists-manipulating-lines.ipynb. I've specifically tried to capture and preserve Parrish's foregrounding of how lists and strings can interact when creating text generators. The organization thus adheres closely to hers, while the explanations and most of the examples are mine. I've also made use of a fragment of code from Nick Montfort's [reimplementation of Alison Knowles' \"House of Dust\"](https://nickm.com/memslam/a_house_of_dust.html). Finally, I've followed Parrish in using [\"Sea Rose\" by H.D.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48188/sea-rose) to illustrate some key concepts."

On the contrary, their duality is signaled at the level of syntax: a word within a list, for example, is enclosed within quotation marks to indicate its individual status as a string, while simultaneously being embedded in square brackets alongside other items to indicate its membership in a list. Numbers, in turn, differentiate themselves from letters by foregoing the quotation marks. The Python interactive interpreter is constantly dealing with list elements at both syntactical levels. In the case of the sum() function, for example, it first assesses the data type of individual elements to determine if they're numerical before subsequently adding them all together at the list level. This double structure is a hallmark of lists."

    "### Converting Lists into Strings   \n",
    "When we're modifying existing poems to create new poems, we'll often want to convert the original poem from a string into a list, modify the list elements in some way, and then convert them back to a string. We've now seen how to do the first part of that sequence--convert a string into a list--but how do we move in the other direction, converting a list into a string? The solution is to use the join() method. Let's look at an example. First, we'll assign a list to a variable:"
